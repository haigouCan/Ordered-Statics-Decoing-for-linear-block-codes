# Ordered-Statics-Decoing-for-linear-block-codes
This work is a  recurrence of the paper 'Soft-Decision Decoding of Linear Block Codes Based on Ordered Statistics '. You can find the paper at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/412683. 

This work gives a low-complexity decoding algorithm, the ordered statistics decoding(OSD) algorithm, and can guarantee the error performance associated with maximum-ikelihood decoding(MLD) for a given range of bit-error rates(BER). This algorithm uses the absolut value as the reliability infromation to reorder the received symbols and generation matrix, and then uses the hard desion of first K symbols with bigger reliability as the new information vector to generate new codewords.
